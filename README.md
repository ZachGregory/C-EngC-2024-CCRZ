Code for C-EngC
Group: Charlie Brockmann, Conner Taraba, Riley Rogers, Zach Gregory

This program uses an ultrasonic sensor, and colour sensor for detecting its environment and controlling motors to navigate. 
We use an ESP32 microcontroller and an arduino motor shield. 

ColorSense: Standalone program for testing the colour sensor 

DriveCode: Program designed to find and repeatedly lift the cod to get points

DriveCodeLine: Program designed to follow the tape path and get points through various methods.
